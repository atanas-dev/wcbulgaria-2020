"AAInfo": "This is a CodeKit 3 project config file. MODIFYING THE CONTENTS OF THIS FILE IS A POOR LIFE DECISION. Doing so will cause CodeKit to crash and/or corrupt your project. I know it looks like JSON, but it is *not*. Many numbers in this file are 64-bit long long bitFlags, which JSON does not support. These numbers *cannot* be treated as discrete values and if you attempt to parse this file as standard JSON with any public JSON parser, these values will be corrupted. This file is not backwards-compatible with CodeKit 1 or 2. For more information, see https://codekitapp.com/",
